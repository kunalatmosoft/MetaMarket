# Metamarket

Metamarket is a decentralized prediction market platform built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org). Users can create, participate, and resolve markets using blockchain technology. It supports real-time tracking of bets, smart contract-based transactions, and local blockchain development using Ganache.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Create Markets** ‚Äì Users can create prediction markets with custom questions and resolution sources.  
- ‚úÖ **Place Bets** ‚Äì Participate by betting on "Yes" or "No" outcomes using ETH.  
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates** ‚Äì Market shares and user positions are updated instantly.  
- ‚úÖ **Resolve Markets** ‚Äì Market creators can resolve markets after the resolution date.  
- ‚úÖ **User Dashboard** ‚Äì View your current bets, total positions, and claim payouts for resolved markets.  
- ‚úÖ **Local Blockchain Support** ‚Äì Fully compatible with Ganache for testing and local development.  
- ‚úÖ **Recharts Integration** ‚Äì Visualize market trends with real-time charts.  
- ‚úÖ **Persistence** ‚Äì Market data is stored locally for instant reloads and offline testing.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family by Vercel.

## Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Create Next.js Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest .
```

### 2. Initialize Hardhat

```bash
npx hardhat --init
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Add any extra dependencies as needed (e.g., OpenZeppelin).

### 4. Compile Solidity Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 5. Deploy Contracts to a Network

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ganache
```

> Replace `ganache` with `localhost`, `sepolia`, `megaeth`, or other networks as needed.

### 6. Start Ganache Local Blockchain

```bash
npx ganache --wallet.seed "metamarket" --db ./ganache-data --port 8585
```

> "metamarket" is the mnemonic; you can use a different one.
> This creates 100 ETH wallets for testing in Metamask.
