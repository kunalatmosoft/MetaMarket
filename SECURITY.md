2. Include:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (optional)

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and work to resolve it promptly.

## Security Best Practices

To help keep your application safe, follow these guidelines:

- Always **validate and sanitize user inputs**.
- Never commit **sensitive information** (API keys, passwords, private keys) to the repository.
- Use **HTTPS** for all communications.
- Keep dependencies updated and monitor for known vulnerabilities.
- Limit permissions and access rights to only what is necessary.
